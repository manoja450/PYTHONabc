Based on different pieces of evidence regarding dark matter, scientists are doing their best to detect it. They mainly use three methods of dark matter detection, namely: indirect detection, direct detection, and the production method.
In indirect detection, we look for a product formed by the process of annihilation or decay of dark matter particles. This method assumes that when dark matter particles collide, annihilate, or decay, they produce standard model particles. We then search for the signature of missing energy resulting from the interaction.
Another method is the production method, in which standard model particles collide at high speeds (relativistic speeds) with other standard model particles. This collision produces both additional standard model particles and dark matter particles. Subsequently, the dark matter particles escape, and we search for the signature of missing energy.
